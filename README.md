#### Implementation of Multiple Time Series Forecasting Models

Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
Implements the most basic exponential smoothing method, suitable for forecasting time series with no trend or seasonality.

Holt Exponential Smoothing (HES)
Incorporates a trend component, making it appropriate for time series with a linear trend.

Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES)
Accounts for both trend and seasonal factors, ideal for data with pronounced seasonality.

:) It will also include other forecasting models or auxiliary methods (such as ARIMA, LSTM, etc., currently under update).
